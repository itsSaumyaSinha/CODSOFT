THE CHALLENGE is to keep making guesses, adjusting the range based on the hints, until the right guessed number is figured out ."

For task 2: THE SIMPLE CALCULATOR-
"The simple calculator program developed allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. Upon execution, the program prompts the user to enter two numeric values and an operator (such as +, -, *, or /).
Using a switch statement, the program determines the selected operation and calculates the result accordingly.
This basic calculator program showcases fundamental concepts of user input, decision-making, and arithmetic operations in C++."
